    			<main>
    			<h2>Summary</h2>
    			<p> The experiment is done in free space and free fall with no confining
    			lasers, no collisions with gasses or walls, and
    			no applied magnetic field. Electric field quantization eliminates first-order
    			motional magnetic field systematic effects that mimic an EDM 
    			and reduction of residual magnetic
    			fields to pT levels suppresses higher order systematic effects. 
    			The fountain geometry produces velocity cancellation on an atom-by atom
    			basis.</p>
    			<p> An EDM experiment can return a null result for reasons other than
  			the absence of an EDM and can return a positive result for reasons other
  			than the presence of an EDM. Our experiment minimizes both of these risks.</p>
   		<br>
   	<div class="column_one">
   
   	<h2>Verifying Experimental Sensitivity</h2>
  			<p> There are numerous measurements to verify that the experiment is working 
  			as intended and to experimentally determine its sensitivity
  			Among others:
  			<ul><li>Measurement of the tensor polarizability [1] (quadratic Stark shift)
  			between magnetic sub levels of the cesium 6S<sub>1/2</sub> F=4 ground state:
  		 tests the presence and strength of the electric field, 
  		tests state preparation, and fountain dynamics. It measures fluctuations 
  		in residual magnetic fields
  		(noise), and sensitivity to energy shifts.</li>
  		<br>
  		<li>Measuring splittings in the magnetic sublevels upon 
  		application and reversal of a very small magnetic field [2]: tests our
  		data acquisition system, preparation of different superpositions
  		of magnetic sublevels and their analysis, magnetic field measurement,
  		 and overall experimental sensitivity.</li>
  		<br>
  		<li>Electric field reversal in the presence of a magnetic field to observe
  		first-order electric-field and velocity- dependent motional magnetic field effects:
  		tests electric field switching, data acquisition, beam dynamics, 
  		magnetic field application,
  		velocity measurement and state preparation and analysis.
  		</li>	</ul>
</p><br>
  			
			<h2> Experimental Method</h2>
			<p> A simplified version (proof-of principal) cesium fountain 
			EDM experiment using 
			electric field quantization has been performed. The publication [3] 
			and includes a short description of the method.  A measurement
			of the cesium static polarizability [4] done using the same fountain
			contains additional details. </p>
			
			<p>As part of our letter of intent to TRIUMF for a francium EDM experiment, 
			which we have recently decided not to pursue, we [4] prepared
			a project document detailing how the experiment would work, 
			and how it would be built and operated.
			it applies also to cesium with minor changes to
			account for a smaller mass, smaller nuclear spin,
			hyperfine splitting, ground-state tensor polarizability, and ionization potential
			and larger scalar polarizability.</p>

			 <h2> Control of EDM-Mimicking Effects</h2>
			 
			 	</p>
			 	 As described in [1] and [2], the most important EDM-mimicking effect is the
			 	magnetic field <strong>B</strong> seen in the rest frame 
			 	of the atom moving at velocity <strong>v</strong>
			 	in the applied electric field <strong>E</strong>: <br>
			 
			 	<center><strong>B</strong> = <strong>v</strong>
			 	&times; <strong>E</strong>/c<sup>2</sup>.<br></center>
			 	where <strong>B</strong> is perpendicular to <strong>E</strong>.
			  Slow atoms minimize the effect,
			 	a perfect fountain would cancel the effect, and perfect
			 	alignment of <strong>E</strong> with any external applied magnetic field
			 	would remove the EDM-mimicking component of magnetic field.</p>
			 	
			 	<p>In place of an external magnetic field, the experiment uses a 
			 	strong electric field
			 	to set the axis of quantization and lift the degeneracy 
				between states of different m<sub>F</sub><sup>2</sup>, where m<sub>F</sub>
				is the magnetic quantum number of the state.  
			 	Electric field quantization eliminates the EDM-mimicking effect 
			 	in first order and all other odd orders.</p>
			 	
			 	<p>In second order, the effect scales with the sizes of
			 	 residual magnetic fields that are parallel and perpendicular to 
			 	 the electric field, and with the atom's net velocity. They scale
			 	 inversely as powers of the electric field and the 
			 	 m<sub>F</sub> state of the atom.

			</figure> </p>
			 	
			 	<p>Some of the things we do to control EDM-mimicking effects:
			 	<ul><li> Use a fountain of ultra-cold atoms such that the each atom's
			 	net velocity cancels</li><br>
				
				<li> Use electric field quantization to eliminate first order motional
				magnetic field EDM mimicking effects.</li><br>
				
				<li> Use demagnetized magnetic shields to reduce residual static
				magnetic fields. </li><br>
				
				<li> Use the fountain as a magnetometer to measure residual 
				magnetic fields over the atoms trajectory and then null these fields.</li><br>
				
				<li> Prepare a superpositions of different +m<sub>F</sub> and 
				-m<sub>F</sub> states 
				whose composition can be changed by rotating the laser polarization.
				 We can change the sensitivity to an electron EDM and to motional 
				 EDM-mimicking effects (including making the EDM sensitivity zero) [1]. 
				 </li> <br>
			
				<li>Adjust the electric field 
					so that the phase advance due to the Stark effect is, for every 
					m<sub>F</sub> state a multiple of &pi;.</ul></p><br>
					
					<p>Because we use a superposition 
					of +m<sub>F</sub> and -m<sub>F</sub> states, 
					an incomplete reversal of the electric field 
					does not lead to a systematic effect. The tensor polarizability
					scales with m<sub>F</sub> as +m<sub>F</sub><sup>2</sup> 
					and with electric field E 
					as E<sup>2</sup>, so that absent an EDM, +m<sub>F</sub> and 
					-m<sub>F</sub> states 
					have the same interaction with the electric field. </p> <br>
						

			  <h2> Testing the Control of EDM-Mimicking Effects</h2>
			  
			 <p>Some of the tests we plan to conduct:
			 <ul><li>Displace the state preparation location from the analysis location
			 resulting in a
			 net beam velocity, then show that applied magnetic
			 fields produce the expected second-order EDM-mimicking effects and that
			 they scales with the magnetic fields and with velocity.</li><br>
			 
			 <li> Use a net atom velocity, 
			 to minimize the residual magnetic fields.</li><br>
			
			 <li>Use applied magnetic fields to fine tune the fountain 
			 to minimize net velocity.
			 Note: When used as a magnetometer, the fountain
			 has fT sensitivity.</li><br>
			 
			 <li> Use different superpositions of m<sub>F</sub> states to verify 
			 the m<sub>F</sub> scaling.</li><br>
			 
		<li>Test for incomplete electric reversal effects by programing the power supplies,
		changing the laser polarization, and detuning the phase advance.</li><br>
		
		<li>Test for magnetization from electric field plate charging currents by shortening 
		the charging time to produce high peak charging currents. 
		<!--Also short the
		electric field plates and run D.C. currents through the apparatus.--></li><br>
		
		<li>Test for sensitivity to EDM-mimicking effects due to 
		external magnetic fields synchronous 
		with the electric field reversal by setting up an external synchronous field,
		measuring its effect. </li><br>
		
		<li>Test for the effects of electric field edge defection by moving the 
		launch position of the atoms. </li><br>
		
		</ul></p><br>
