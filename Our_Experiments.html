			<h2>Current Fountain Experiments</h2>
					<p> A new cesium fountain EDM experiment using a fountain of 
					ultra cold atoms is being built
     	  			using experience gained from our previous EDM and cold atom
     	  			fountain experiments [1-5] and related calculations [6,7].</p>

								<p>Cesium EDM Lab: A corner of the Laser table is in 
								the foreground with the 
								diode laser controls. The
								Magneto Optical Trap (MOT) is in the middle ground with a display
								in front of the fountain tower. 
								Telescope arms can be seen emerging from
								the MOT chamber at 45 degrees.
								The white dot on the two displays is a TV camera image of
								a cesium MOT which shines in the near infrared.</p>
									<p>For launching atoms in a moving molasses,
							we use moving retroreflectors in place of acousto-optical modulators, 
			and a system for switching between trapping optics and launching optics
			that preserves laser power. We also mounted collimators on five-axis
			mirror mounts to make it easier to 
						couple laser light into the single-mode optical fiber.</p>
							</figcaption>
						</figure>   
			<p>This experiment is intended to set a useful limit to the electron EDM,
			and to verify
			 methods for determining experimental sensitivity and for
		suppressing EDM-mimicking effects (See Experimental Method and
		Systematic Effects). </p>
		
		<p>The EDM-mimicking motional systematic scales as the product of
		<strong>B<sub>&parallel;</sub></strong> &times; 
		<strong>B<sub>&perp;</sub></strong> &times; 
		<strong>B<sub>motional</sub></strong>, 
		where <strong>B<sub>&parallel;</sub></strong> and 
		<strong>B<sub>&perp;</sub></strong> are the residual magnetic
		fields parallel and perpendicular to the electric field (<strong>E</strong>) and
		<strong>B<sub>motional</sub></strong> &equals; 
		<strong>v</strong>&times;<strong>E</strong>/c<sup>2</sup>, 
		is the magnetic field seen by the atom moving through the 
		electric field <strong>E</strong> with net velocity <strong>v</strong>
	 and c is the speed of light. The EDM mimicking effect also scales as inverse powers 
	 of both the
	 electric field and absolute quantum number of the magnetic sublevel, 
	 |m<sub>F</sub>|. </p>
	 
	 <p> These relations will be tested by applying known
	 magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the electric field, by varying
	 the net velocity of the atoms (by displacing the state preparation and analysis
	 regions), by varying the strength of the electric field, by changing the
	 composition of the superposition of m<sub>F</sub> states, and by
	 displacing the phase advance from intiger values of &pi; by adjusting both the
	 electric field and residual magnetic field over the atom's rise and fall in
	 the electric field. </p>
		
<p>We will also test for effects due to laser polarization error,
	 incomplete electrical field reversal, 
	 electric field charging currents, voltage discharge, etc.</p> <br>
	 
<h2> Magnetic Shielding Tests </h2>
      		<p>Effective and stable magnetic shielding is essential because 
      		the electron has a large magnetic dipole moment, the Earth 
      		has a large and varying magnetic field, and human activity causes
      		fluctuations in the local magnetic field. </p>
      		
      	<p> Our magnetic shields with endcaps are designed by us, fabricated 
      	(cut, rolled, and welded) at LBNL, heat treated locally, and carried by us back 
      	to our laboratory where we test them.

			<h2> Next Generation  Experiments using an Intense Beam of Atoms and 
			Stronger Electric Fields</h2> 
			<h3>Intense Beams of Atoms</h3>
		  		<p> While our present cesium fountain intensity is sufficient 
		  		to develop our technique and provide a useful electron EDM limit, 
		  		true EDM discovery potential requires orders of magnitude more 
		  		sensitivity, which can come from orders of  magnitude more 
		  		intense cesium sources</p>
		  		
      	 	<p>A magneto optical trap can trap 
      		about 10<sup>9</sup> cesium atoms when using a high-power laser 
      		and considerably fewer using our low-power laser. 
      		Ordinary  thermal beam cesium sources (with or without material recovery)
      		produce 10<sup>18</sup> atoms per second per steradian per cm<sup>2</sup>
      		of orifice [1], and Cs supersonic jet sources have produced 
      		much higher fluxes [2].
      		</p>
  				
				<p> Deceleration of thermal beams using a counter-propagating laser 
				has been used to produce beams of slow atoms, typically to load 
				 magneto optical traps, where 10<sup>9</sup> atoms is sufficient.
				Referred to as Zeeman Slowers, they use a tapered magnetic field to keep the 
				decelerating atoms
				in resonance with the laser as the atom's Doppler shift decreases.
				</p>
				
				<p> Because of the high transverse velocity of the thermal beam, the initial
				acceptance of the decelerator is of the order of 10<sup>-2</sup> steradians
				or less.
				The acceptance is further reduced because, as atoms are slowed,
				 their angular divergence increases
				(normalized emittance growth in accelerator speak). </p>
				
				<p>The emittance can be reduced using multiple stages of transverse cooling
				combined with focusing (and possibly defocusing and drift spaces).
				A conceptual design for such a decelerator, using transverse focusing 
				and cooling between stages of
				deceleration was developed for a francium experiment. The report
				chapter can be downloaded  
  			 <a href="Chapter_10.pdf" >here.</a> and
			the Bibliiography can be downloaded
			<a href="Bibliography.pdf" >here</a>.</p>
				
			<p>We are starting work on a decelerator conceptual design which will be published.
			This will be followed by construction of a prototype to test emittance control
			and beam transport from the horizontal decelerator into a vertical fountain.</p>
  			Some of our previous work on focusing and bunching slow cesium atoms may be
  			found in Ref's [3,4] and a conceptual design for a storage ring for molecules
  			in Ref [5]<br>
  			
  		<h3> Strong Electric Fields </h3>
  		<p> We will also increase the electric field by a factor of four by replacing metal
  		electrodes with
  		heated (soda-lime) glass electric field plates. This will reduce
  		any EDM-mimicking motional magnetic field effect by a factor of 64 
  		(See Experimental Method and Systematic Effects) while increasing the sensitivity
  		to an EDM by a factor of four.</p>
  		
  		<p>Glass electrodes sustain larger electric fields than
  		metal electrodes because the glass conducts by (Na<sup>+</sup>) ion transport
  		rather than electrons, the ions being more difficult to remove from the surface.
  		The high resistivity also causes a local voltage drop when a micro discharge begins,
  		which helps quench the discharge. Heated glass electrodes have been used in thallium
  		beam polarizability experiments at fields of 45 MV/m [6].</p>
  		
  		<h3> Five Year Plan </h3>
  		<p> Subject to: our ability to recruit collaborators, continued access to LBNL 
  		facilities and technical support, political and financial
  		stability, good health, the absence of new pandemics, and all else that can go wrong, 
  		we plan:
