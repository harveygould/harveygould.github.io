		<ul> <li>We do not fully understand how an electron EDM generates an
		effect in a molecule, 
		how large it would be, and if it would be different in the molecule's 
		rest frame than in the laboratory rest frame.</li><br>
		
		<li>We do not know how to prove the sensitivity of the experiment 
		to an EDM signal.</li><br>

		<li>We do not know how to prove that a signal is not an EDM mimic.</li><br>

		<li>We would not have sufficient confidence to tell someone proposing a model 
		that our EDM result from a  molecule experiment discredited the model, 
		nor the confidence to use the experimental result to advise on
		the construction of a future collider.</li></ul>
