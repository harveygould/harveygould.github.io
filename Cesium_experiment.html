			<h3> Experimental Method </h3>
				
				<p> Both the Cs and Fr experiments will be done using 
					 fountains of ultra-cold atoms. 
					 Systematic effects are suppressed by conducting the measurement
					 in free space, free fall, and zero applied magnetic field,
					 with only a static electric field 
					 in between optical state-preparation and analysis. </p>

						<cite> Electron electric-dipole-moment exeriment using
						electric field quantized slow cesium atoms</cite>,
						which was a prototype for this experiment. Wundt, Jentschura, and Munger 
						<a href="http://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.2.041009" target = "blank">
 		 				have published </a> 
 		 				<cite>Quantum dynamics in atomic- fountain experiments for measuring the 
 						electric dipole moment of the electron with improved sensitivity</cite>, 
						which describes the sensitivity to - and the suppression of-
						systematic effects for Cs and, in it&rsquo;s supplement, for Fr.

			<h3> Determining Experimental Sensitivity </h3>
					<p> The sensitivity will be calibrated by deliberately introducing a 
					small geometric phase advance:  
					it produces an effect of known size, linear 
					in electric field, and synchronous with electric field reversal.</p>
				
				<p> Further calibration will use the tensor polarizability, through which
				an electric field lifts the degeneracy between magnetic sublevels of 
				different absolute quantum numbers |M| of the same hyperfine level. 
				This entirely relativistic effect
				arises from differences in the radial wave functions of the |M| states.
				As such, the size of the tensor polarizability correlates with the atom's 
				sensitivity to an electron EDM and
				to parity nonconservation effects. (An EDM allows an electric field to lift the
				degeneracy <em> between </em> Â±M states.)

						<p>We have developed some new fountain techniques including the use
						of moving retroreflectors in place of acousto-optical modulators, 
						a system for switching between trapping optics and launching optics
						that preserves laser power, and an easy to use method of 
						launching laser light into a single-mode optical fiber.
