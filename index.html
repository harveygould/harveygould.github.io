        			<p> In the Standard Model, electron EDMs are probably too small to observe. 
       				But some models of dark matter, baryon excess, axion production, and 
        				especially Supersymmetry generate much larger electron EDMs.

         		Why can't we find an EDM? </a> 
      		</h3>
      		
        			<p> Many Supersymmetry calculations predict electron EDMs 
        				larger than experimental limits.
        				No experiment has yet claimed to observe an EDM in any system, 
        				and over 50 experiments have null results.

        			<p> Alkali atoms are well understood: The enhancement of the electron's EDM
        				in Cs or Fr is established from field theory.
       				Sensitivity to an EDM and to major systematic effects
       				can be independently determined in Cs and Fr fountain experiments.

     	  			<p> After a proof-of-principle Cs fountain EDM experiment, we are
     	  				developing new prototypes fountains to test parts of the EDM experiments 
     	 	   		that involving extremely small magnetic field
     	      		and large electric field.

		 		<p> EDM experiments need shielding to reduce magnetic fields 
		  		 	and magnetic field noise. We have discovered some unexpected properties 
		  			of common shielding material that can affect many sensitive experiments.
