	<h3>  Electron EDM experiments place constraints on models of dark matter.
			Can we be sure that the EDM experiments are as sensitive as claimed?
			Can we be sure that the experiments can detect an EDM?
			<br>
			<br>
			New electron EDM experiments with verifiable sensitivity
			and robust protection against false positives are being developed for 
			cesium and francium.

     	  			<p> A new cesium fountain EDM experiment is being built at Lawrence
     	  			Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)
     	  			using experience gained from our previous cold atom
     	  			fountain experiments.
     	  			</p> <br>
     	  	
			
			 			<h3>	<a href="francium.html"> Francium EDM Experiment </a> </h3>
				<p> Compared to cesium, francium is more sensitive to an electron EDM and less
					sensitive to false positives. 
					The francium EDM experiment will be done at TRIUMF. </p>

        			<h3>  <a href= "magnetic_shielding.html"> Magnetic Shielding </a> </h3>
        			
        			<p> Magnetic shielding is essential to EDM and other magnetic-field
        			sensitive experiments. Our measurements are uncovering ways 
        			to use shielding more effectively.
