      	<h2> Who We Are </h2>
      	<p> We are a a precision measurements group specializing in experiments that
      	are best done in a national laboratory setting. For many years we did
      	heavy ion accelerator based experiments using the LBNL Super-HILAC, and Bevalac,
      	and the Brookhaven AGS. Our extended group collectively has nearly a century of
      	experience in designing, upgrading, operating, and performing experiments
      	at accelerators.</p>
      	<p> Precision electron EDM experiments using a ten or twenty 
      	meter-long decelerator that we design, build and operate is suited
      	to our interests and capabilities.</p>
      	
      	Our group includes <a href = 
      	"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory" 
      	target = "blank"> LBNL</a>
      	staff and affiliates (people who are not paid, usually retirees [1]).

  			<li><h2> Other Work </h2></li>
  				<p> Almost all of us have worked with
  					accelerators; either as experimenters or designers, and or building, 
  					operating, and managing accelerator facilities. 
  					Group members have performed measurements at 
  					Brookhaven AGS (ultra-relativistic atomic collisions with Au); 
  					CERN SPS (ultra-relativistic atomic collisions); 
  					Fermilab Antiproton Accumulator (antihydrogen);
  					GANIL (electron-photons scattering); LBNL Advanced Light Source 
  					(photodissociation of hydrogen, molecular fragmentation);
  					LBNL Bevalac (Lamb Shift in
  					few electron Uranium, and bound-free pair production in 
  					relativistic atomic collisions);
,   				 and SLAC (Z decay). There are many publications in the literature from
					our work.

  				<h2> Support </h2>			
  				<p> We have ongoing and stable support at LBNL through 
  					the Electron Electric Dipole Moment Research Foundation, a 501(c)(3)
  					charitable foundation. The EIN is 46-5120460 and its tax returns (990P)
  					 are a public record and can be searched online. </p>
  					 
  					 <p> In the past we have had support from the Office of Science,
  					 U.S. Department of Energy, including Laboratory Directed Research and
  					 Development Funds, and from NASA, and from a NIST Precision Measurements
  					 Grant.
  					 Collaborators who wish to apply for government funding 
  					 and run their own groups
  					 are encouraged to do so.</p><hr>
  			<h3>Notes</h3>
  			<ol><li> LBNL, as part of the University of California, has a 
  			defined benefit retirement plan. Many employees retire and continue to
  			work as unpaid affiliates. Collaborators working at LBNL who are not
  			paid by LBNL are also affiliates.</li><br> 
  			
  			<li> There is a second Harvey Gould who does not do experiments.</li>

		<h2> Working with Us </h2>
  	  				<!-- ><p> Email <a href = "http://phonebook.lbl.gov/" target = "blank">  
					Harvey Gould</a> for further information. 
					
  	  			<p> Email <a href= "mailto: hagould@lbl.gov"> Harvey Gould </a> 
  	  			for additional information</p>  </p> -->
  	  			<h3> Who May be Interested </h3>
  	  			<p> Our small, but difficult experiments may appeal to people interested in
  	  			fundamental physics and in doing hands-on precision measurements, 
  				acquiring new experimental skills,
  				and working with LBNL staff to solve a wide range of unique problems. 
  				Much of the  technical knowledge needed
  				is acquired on the job. </p>		
  				
  			<p> If you are interested in working on an electron EDM experiment but would
  			prefer to compete with us, we can help you get started. 
  			Discovery of an electron EDM will likely require an 
  			independent confirming experiment (think dark energy). </p>
  			<br>
  			<h3> Open Position  </h3>
  			<p>We have recently filled one Postdoc position and are planning to post 
  			for a second PostDoctoral Fellow or another position in the 
  			Accelerator Technology and Applied Physics (ATAP) Division.
  			If you are interested, contact Harvey Gould. </p>
  			
  			 <p>ATAP Division </a> is part of the LBNL 
  			 <a href="https://physicalsciences.lbl.gov/" target="blank">
  			 Physical Sciences Area</a>  and its 
  			 pay scale and culture is aligned with that of Physics Division. 
  			 In FY-2025, first year postdoctoral salary was above $90k/yr.
  			 In addition to the incentives, career opportunities, and benefits 
  			 listed <a href="https://careers.lbl.gov/" target="blank">
					here</a>, and 
					<a href="https://c2mb.ajg.com/uc/home/" target="blank">
					benefits specific to PostDocs</a>, LBNL PostDocs are 
  			 <a href="https://uaw5810.org/postdoc-contract/" target="blank">
					represented</a>
  			 by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and 
  			 Agricultural Implement Workers of America, 
  			 AFL-CIO and its local Union 5810.</p>

			<br>
  			<h3> Collaborations </h3>
  				<p> Through our accelerator work, we have a long history of collaboration 
  				with other groups and individuals at all professional levels. 
  				Past and present collaborators
  					include retirees, LBNL staff, university faculty, visiting faculty,
  					post doctoral fellows, 
  					high school physics teachers, graduate student research assistants,
  					post bacalaureate fellows,  
  					undergraduate assistants, and unpaid spouses.
  					<!--We have had excellent experiences working with people who are
  					neurodivergent. --> </p>
  					
  					<p>Our work would not be possible without the work of a large number
  					of talented, knowledgable, and hard-working theoreists. We look forward
  					to continuing this tradition. </p>
  			
  				<p> Limited-term paid positions, travel support, visits,
  				unpaid positions, and other arrangements,
  				can be made available through LBNL. </p>
  				Contact <a href= "mailto: hagould@lbl.gov"> Harvey Gould </a>
  				if you are interested in 
  				working or collaborating with us.</p>
