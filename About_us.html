      	<h2> About Us </h2>
      	
				<p>	Presently group members (including part time) are:
					Benedict Feinberg,
					Harvey Gould,
					Yan Li,
					Charles Munger,
					Hiroshi Nishimura, and
					Christopher Timossi. 
					
  				<p> TRIUMF collaborators are John Behr and Matt Pearson. </p>
  				<p> Our theory collaborator is
  				
  				
  				<a href = "https://sites.mst.edu/jentschura/research/" target = "blank"> 
         	Ulrich Jentschura.</a> at Missouri S&T University</p>
  				
  				<p> Most of us have extensive publications
					that can be searched on Google Scholar and in The Physical Review and 
					Physical Review Letters. 
					(note: there is a second Harvey Gould who does not
					do experiments.)</p>
  					
  				<p> Almost all of us have worked with
  					accelerators; either as experimenters or building, operating,
  					and managing accelerators. Group members have performed measurements at 
  				BNL, CERN, FNAL, GANIL, LBNL, and SLAC. <!--We have experience making 
  					thermal beams of francium and with collaborators at Boulder, 
  					trapping francium from a radioactive source. -->
  					     				
  						<p> We have ongoing and stable support at LBNL through 
  					the Electron Electric Dipole Moment Foundation.
  				</p>
  					
  					<!-- Past and present collaborators
  					include retirees, LBNL staff, University Faculty, Post Doctoral Fellows, 
  					Post Bacaluareate Fellows, Graduate Students, and Undergraduate Assistants.
  					We have had good experiences working with neurodivergents. 
  				</p>
