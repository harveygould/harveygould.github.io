      		<h3> Francium Experiment Following a Cs Experiment </h3>
      		<p> Francium is about nine times more sensitive to and electron EDM than is
      		cesium and is expected to be ten times less sensitive to the major systematic
      		effects. If an effect is seen in cesium, finding a larger effect in francium
      		is a powerful confirmation. If no effect is seen in cesium, the added
      		sensitivity and better systematic supression of francium make it the logical
      		next step. </p>

				<p> Beams of 
				1.9 x 10<sup>9</sup> atoms s<sup>-1</sup> of <sup>211</sup>Fr </a>
				are produced at TRIUMF
					<a href = "http://www.triumf.ca/" target = "blank"> TRIUMF</a>,
					where 500 MeV protons striking a uranium carbide or thorium carbide target
					produce a range of isotopes which are 
					<a href = "http://www.triumf.ca/home/about-triumf/about-us/faq-about-triumf/isac-backgrounder" target = "blank">
					separated on-line</a> to yield
					a beam of <sup>211</sup>Fr which has a half life of 3.1 minutes.
					The decay products of <sup>211</sup>Fr  
 					do not include long-lived isotopes of polonium or other 
 					easily vaporized elements.

			<h3>Transition to Francium</h3>
			<p> Accelerator beam time is generally limited to weeks per year so it is
			desirable to have another source of francium for development work. 
		 <sup>221</sup>Fr (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.5 min) can be obtained from the alpha decay 
					of commercially available <sup>225</sup>Ac which has a ten-day half life.
					<sup>221</sup>Fr obtained 
					from a <sup>225</sup>Ac source
