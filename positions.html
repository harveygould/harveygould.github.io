  	  			<p> We do small, but difficult experiments that should appeal to people
  				interested in performing precision measurements,
  				acquiring new experimental skills, 
  				doing hands-on measurements,
  				and working with LBNL staff to solve a wide range of unique problems. 
  				The work is advanced and much of
  				the needed technical knowledge
  				is acquired on the job. </p>

  			<p> <strong> Collaborations </strong> </p>
  				<p> We have a decades-long history of collaboration with outside groups
  				and individuals. Contact <a href= "mailto: hagould@lbl.gov"> Harvey Gould </a>
  				if you are interested in 
  				working with us at LBNL on the Cs EDM experiment or magnetic shielding
  				demagnetization, or at
  				TRIUMF on the Fr EDM experiment. </p>

  <!-- 				<p> Most of the people presently working on this project have worked with
  					accelerators; either as experimenters or Accelerator Physicists.    				
  					Past and present collaborators
  					include retirees, LBNL staff, University Faculty, Post Doctoral Fellows, 
  					Post Bacaluareate Fellows, Graduate Students, and Undergraduate Assistants.
  					We have had good experiences working with neurodivergents.

  				<p> For work on franciu, we are collaborating with scientists at TRIUMF
  					and anticipate widening the collaboration to meet the needs of
  					an accelerator based experiment.
