   	<li><h2> Enhancement/Suppression of Electron EDM in Atoms </h2></li>	
   		<p> A parity- and time reversal- violating electric dipole moment of 
			an atom is defined in "terms of a linear shift of the energy of the atom
			as a uniform electric field E is applied to it"[1].
			The energy shift is taken in the limit of infinitesimally 
			small electric field, which removes any induced electric dipole moments 
			(atomic polarizability) whose magnitude depends on E. 
			This can occur when there are (nearly)
			degenerate states of opposite parity mixed by the electric field.</p>
		
			<p> An alkali atom can have an EDM that is larger or smaller than
			the electron EDM[2].  Enhancement is the result of relativistic
  		effects and the mixing of states of opposite parity (along
  		with time-reversal violation). The relativistic effects scale as high powers
  		of the atomic number Z as they do for other relativistic effects 
  		such as the spin-orbit interaction, which is entirely relativistic, 
  		and atomic parity violation, which takes place at small
  		nuclear distances and has a large relativistic component.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  		In heavy alkali atoms, the s state valence electron,
  		 whose wavefunction extends
  		to the origin, experiences a strong, unshielded, Coulomb field 
  		where the singular behavior <!--&prop; 1/r -->of the  
  		interaction at short distances makes the mixing with
  		opposite-parity states (e.g P<sub>1/2</sub> and P<sub>3/2</sub> states)
  		very strong.
  		And in the inner core of a high Z
  		alkali, the valence  electron's velocity, of order v/c &asymp; Z &alpha; 
  		becomes comparable to the speed of light, making spin-orbit effects large:
  		the P<sub>1/2</sub> - P<sub>3/2</sub> fine structure splitting in Cs is
  		1.8 % of the binding energy. In Fr it is over 5%. </p>	
  		
			<p>Although an atom EDM may arise from sources other than an electron 
  			EDM, heavy alkali atoms are presumed much more sensitive to an electron EDM 
  			than to an EDM of nucleons, a nuclear EDM, or a parity- 
  			and time reversal- violating: electron-nucleus, nucleon-nucleon, or 
  			electron-electron interaction; although any 
  			one of these would be welcome as evidence of new physics.</p>
  				
		<p>The ratio, R of an atomic EDM of some alkali atom S<sub>1/2</sub> 
		ground state to an electron EDM 
  		is shown in Table 1. Also shown is R for thallium which has a 
  		6P<sub>1/2</sub> ground state.</p>
  		 <br>
  		<li><h2>Calculation of Enhancement Factors</h2></li>
     	<ul><li><h3> Reliability of Alkali Atom Calculations </h3></li>
     <p> Calculations of enhancement/suppression of electron EDMs in alkali atoms 
     are highly reliable because they are similar to the hundreds of other
      calculations of measured quantities in the same alkali atoms, especially cesium [3], 
      using similar relativistic codes and wavefunctions and carried out by 
      most of the same authors who calculate R.</p>
      <p> And other than for R, these calculations have been tested, often 
      in precision measurements,
       including atomic transition probabilities [3], hyperfine splittings,
      scalar[4], and tensor polarizability, and parity violation 
      transition amplitude[5]. </p>
      <br>
	<li><h3>Accuracy of Alkali Atom  Calculations</h3></li>
      <p> The uncertainty in R is likely &plusmn; 3% for cesium and slightly larger
      for francium. 
       This can be seen in Table I, from the spread in published results, 
       especially since 1985, 
      from authors estimates, from the change in values
       as higher order terms have been added and from comparison with the improvement 
       in other calculated quantities. </p>
       
       This compares with accuracies for parity violation amplitude of 
       about &plusmn; 1% in Cs.
       This is because R has not needed to be known to the same accuracy and 
       so has not commanded as much effort:
        it matters little if the enhancement factor of cesium is 115 or 120 when no EDM 
      has been observed and no model for an electron EDM has a favored superpartner 
      mass or CP-violating
      phase with which to predict an exact value for the electron EDM.</p><br>
      
       <!--As there is no exact Hamiltonian that describes the interaction 
      of two relativistic electrons in closed form, improving the precision requires 
      carrying out calculations in successively higher orders of  perturbation theory.-->
   
  		<li><h3>Thallium</h3></li>
		<p>Thallium (Z=81), with a 6p<sub>1/2</sub> ground state[6], 
		a large enhancement factor, low ionization potential, and high vapor pressure,
		 has been used for electron EDM searches and
		its enhancement factor is widely calculated.  For this reason it is
		included in Table I. However Tl is not easily laser trapped or cooled,
		 making it less attractive for future experiments and its enhancement factor 
		 is more difficult to calculate than those of alkali atoms. </p>
		
      </p><br>
    <li> <h3>Atom EDM Ratios</h3></li>
    <p>The EDM enhancement ratios R provide a powerful check against
      an EDM mimic by allowing a comparison between cesium and rubidium and/or francium - 
      all relatively easy to trap and cool. Measured atom EDMs in the ratio of 35:5:1 
      for Fr:Cs:Rb would be compelling evidence that the effect was not an EDM mimic.
      Systematic effects tend to be atom-independent for magnetic field effects,
      or decrease with Z for geometric phase effects. And were a Tl experiment available,
      its EDM of opposite sign (presumably because the p state has opposite parity) could
      be an additional check. </p> <hr>
      
     <!-- <p> The calculations have also become more reliable because it is now
       common practice to test terms in the calculations
      against measurements and calculations of known quantities to assess the precision of
      each successive order of perturbation theory and of corrections. Thus matrix elements 
      and transition probabilities for mixing of states, hyperfine splittings for the
      behavior near the nucleus, static polarizability for core effects, and separately,
      parity violation
      for most everything put together.-->
     
    <!--
      <p> A small reduction in the uncertainty would provide a powerful check against
      an EDM mimic by allowing a comparison between cesium and rubidium or francium, all
      relatively easy to trap and cool in sufficient quanties.
      measurements: as magnetic effects do not scale Existing calculations are precise enough to guide experimenters to a little bit
      of extra effort to measure cesium over rubidium and maybe enven francium over cesium.

     		<h2> Atoms with Large Electron EDM Enhancements  </h2>
     		<p> Table I shows the enhancement factors for heavy alkali atoms Rb, Cs,
     		and Fr plus Tl. Most electron EDM 
     		experiments on atoms have used cesium or thallium.
     		<!--The alkalis have in their highest principal 
     		quantum number a single electron which forms an S1/2 ground state. 
     		Tl has, in its highest principal
     		quantum number, two 6s electrons (paired) plus a 6p electron which forms a 6p1/2
     		ground state. Tl resembles an alkali because at high Z 
     		relativistic effects make j=1/2 states similar. But Tl is still different enough 
     		from an alkali atom to be more difficult to calculate.
     		Its enhancement factor is
     		negative presumably because of its opposite parity. -->
     		 Li, Na, and
     		K, not shown in the table, have enhancement factors of 4 x10-3, 0.3, 
     		and about 3 respectively. The Cs and Fr values have been rounded to whole numbers
     		and the author's error estimates where provided are quoted in the footnotes. 
     		<!--Francium has a
     		larger error in part because transition probabilities (matrix elements), energy
     		levels etc. are not as well known as for Cs due to Fr being more difficult to
     		obtain for experiments.-->

		their uncertainty at &pm;3.7%.
		<!--To conclude, we calculated the EDM enhancement fac- tor to be 
		equal to 573 (20). 
		The uncertainty is, somewhat conservatively, assigned based on the accuracy 
		of the relevant hyperfine constants (3%) and total size of all corrections 
		beyond the CI, which is 3.7%. 
		This value differs by 20% from the recently published result of Nataraj et al. [7],
		 but agrees well with the results obtained by Dzuba and Flambaum [6] 
		 and Liu and Kelly [5]. -->

		<!--Adds double core polarization to both parity violation calculations and electron EDM
		enhancement factors bringing several calculations ofeach that use differing treatments closer
		into agreement. It also confirms
		If we treat Tl as a monovalence system, then the DCP contribution to the 
		PNC amplitude is huge. It contributes 36% to the PNC amplitude of the 6p1/2-6p3/2 
		transition and about 60% to the EDM of the ground state. 
		The DCP contribution is strongly dominated by the 6s electrons. 
		This reflects the well-known fact that the correlations between the 
		three outermost electrons in thallium are strong and should be treated accurately. 
		In our view, the best approach is to treat thallium as a triple-valence-electron 
		system and to use the configuration interaction (CI) technique 
		combined with many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) for including 
		valence electrons core interactions. 
		However, good results can be obtained in other approaches too 
		if correlations between 6s and 6p electrons, including the DCP contribution, 
		are treated accurately. In our early calculations of the PNC in thallium [13], 
		it was treated as a monovalence system and the DCP contribution was included. 
		Recent calculations of the EDM enhancement factor [28,31] 
		used the CI approach; the calculations of the Tl EDM based 
		on the coupled-cluster approach [14,32] seems to include the DCP contribution too
		by introducing the perturbed excitation operators T1 and T2 (see [14] for details).
