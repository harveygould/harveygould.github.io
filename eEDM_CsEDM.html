   		<h2>Parity and Time Reversal Violation</h2>
   		<p>Parity violation and time reversal violation are required for 
   		an electron electric dipole moment (EDM). Parity violation and 
   		time-reversal violation are features of the 
   		Standard Model, but no Standard Model calculation predicts an electron EDM
   		large enough to presently be observable. 
   		This makes electron EDM experiments attractive for searching for beyond Standard
   		Model Physics as there are no existing effects to subtract out.</p>
   		
   		<p>And many Standard Model extensions, with new particles and new couplings, 
   		predict electron EDMs much larger than Standard Model EDMs,
   		sometimes large enough to have been observed in existing experiments. </p><br> 
   	
      	<h3> Parity Violation </h3>	
      		<p> Parity violation
      		induced by weak neutral currents, is present in atoms[1].
      		However the first two experiments, with enough sensitivity 
      		to observe parity violation in atoms, failed to find it. 
      		The Seattle group[2] found a value “considerably smaller” 
      		than the Weinberg-Salam theory and the Oxford group[3] found their 
      		result to be  “in disagreement with the Weinberg Salam model...” 
				They published their results in adjacent papers in 
				Physical Review Letters[2,3], after earlier publishing a joint letter
				 in Nature[4] declaring that optical rotation in bismuth, 
				“if it exists, is smaller than the values predicted by the 
				Weinberg Salam model...”</p>	
				
  				<p>The Glashow, Salam, Weinberg model survived these experimental
  				results because, 
  				four years earlier, the Gargamelle experiment[5] had discovered 
  				 weak neutral currents</a>, confirming the
					 model.</p>
						
				<p> Two years after the Seattle/Oxford results, 
				Barkov and Zolotorov published results[6] of a
				 Bismuth optical rotation experiment
				with better control of systematic effects[6] and obtained agreement with 
				prediction.</p><br>
				
				<h3>Parity Violation in Cesium 6S - 7S Transitions </h3>
				<p>Over the next 20 years, atomic parity violation developed into a precision
				measurement through the simultaneous development of experiments with excellent
				control of systematic effects[7-10] and 
				accurate calculations of the effect of parity violation in cesium [11]. 
				These experiments, for which control of systematic effects
				was the major experimental focus, 
				used a beam of cesium (atomic number Z=55) atoms
				and measured the parity-forbidden electric-dipole transition amplitude between  
				the 6S<sub>1/2</sub> ground state and 7S<sub>1/2</sub> excited state.
				Parity violation effects in atoms scale[8] roughly as Z<sup>3</sup>,
				 <!--Gilbert 1986-->a feature shared with the effect of an electron EDM.</p>
				
				<p>They chose cesium over other heavy atoms, because[8] <!--Gilbert 1986-->
				<blockquote>"Cesium has the virtue that it is the 
				simplest heavy atom, having one S-state electron outside a filled inner core. 
				Thus it is highly single-electron in character and calculations 
				of its structure are more direct and accurate than for other heavy atoms.
				In addition, there is a wealth of precise experimental data on the various 
				properties of cesium ground and excited states which can be used for testing 
				and refining calculations of its wave functions." </blockquote></p> <br>
	
			<h3>Time Reversal Violation</h3>
			<p> In addition to parity violation, a permanent electric dipole moment
			 requires time reversal violation. By the CPT theorem, time reversal 
			 violation is equivalent to CP violation where C is charge conjugation, 
			 P is parity and T is time reversal. 
			 </p> <br>
			 
			<h3>Standard Model Electron EDM </h3>
			<p>
			CP-violation is a feature of the 
			 Standard Model and is observed in the quark sector in the (weak interaction)
			 decay of neutral K, D, and B mesons.
			However the observation of parity violation in weak interactions 
			and of CP violation in the quark sector,
			has not lead to any Standard Model calculation yielding an 
			electron EDM large enough to be readily observed [12]. </p>
			
			<p>There also exists the possibility that 
			 neutrinos are Majorana fermions (each its own antiparticle) which allows for 
			 additional mechanisms for generating an electron EDM. 
			 Calculations[13] so far suggest that this too will yield electron EDMs 
			 too small to be readily observed. 
			</p>
			<p>The absence of a readily observable Standard Model electron EDM
			  means that any observed electron EDM is coming from new physics. 
			</p> <br>
			
			<h3> Beyond Standard Model Electron EDM </h3>
			<p> There is no shortage of Standard Model extensions with new particles, 
			new couplings, and new sources of CP violation which would produce 
			an electron EDM. These models typically contain undetermined constants, 
			including the masses of new particles. In some models, the choice of these 
			constants can lead to predictions of electron EDMs large enough to have been 
			observed in previous EDM experiments. <!-- - a tension that experimenters, 
			confident of their results, might yet point out. --> </p>
			
			<p>Different choices of masses and couplings, however can help keep
			 the model viable in the face of decreasing experimental electron EDM limits.
			 An insightful catalog of such models can be found in Bernreuther and
			 Suzuki [14]. In addition,
			 models of electron EDMs appear in all of the papers listed in the sections
			 on electron EDM constraints on Dark Matter, Baryon Asymmetry,
			 Axion-Like Particles, and Neutrino Models. </p><hr>

     		<h2>Electron EDM in the Cesium Ground State</h2><br>
     <p><!--In a magnetic field, the energy of a free electron and of a paramagnetic atom
     depend on the strength of the magnetic field and its direction relative to
     the axis of quantization.-->
    The effect of interest of an electron EDM in cesium is a change in energy of the
   	6S<sub>1/2</sub>, F, m<sub>F</sub> ground state that is linear in applied
   	electric field (linear Stark effect) and linear in m<sub>F</sub>, the projection
   	of the electron spin along the electric field. </p>
   	
   	
   	<p>In an electric field, (an alkali) atom can have an electron-EDM caused energy change 
   	that is larger or smaller than the EDM-caused energy change of a free electron 
   	in the same electric field.
   	Similar to atomic parity violation, the effect
     	of an external electric field will be much larger 
     	in the cesium (Z=55) ground state than in the hydrogen ground state.</p>
   	
   	<p>The ratio R, of the linear Stark effect in the atom,
   	 to the linear Stark effect of the electron,
   	is calculated to be 120 in cesium[1-11]. 
   	In K (Z=19), Rb (Z=37) and Fr (Z=87),
   	it is calculated to be  0.3, 3.0, and &approx; 860, respectively</p>
		 
		<p> The effect of an electron EDM becomes large in high Z alkali atoms 
		because the s state valence electron, whose wavefunction extends
  		to the origin, experiences a strong, unshielded, Coulomb field, 
  		where the singular behavior (&prop; 1/r) of the  
  		interaction at short distances makes the (parity violting) mixing with
  		opposite-parity states (e.g p<sub>1/2</sub> and p<sub>3/2</sub>)
  		very strong.
  		And in the inner core of a high Z
  		alkali, the valence  electron's velocity, of order v/c &asymp; Z &alpha; 
  		becomes an appreciable fraction of the speed of light, 
  		making spin-orbit effects large [13]:
  		the fine structure splitting in Cs (the energy difference between 
  		the D1 and D2 lines) is 1.8 % of the binding energy. </p><br>
  		
  	<h3>Reliability of Cesium Electron EDM Calculations</h3>
     <p> Calculation of the effect of an electron EDM in cesium is highly reliable
     because the calculation is very similar to the calculation of parity violation
     effects in cesium. The parity violation calculation is used to compare 
     experiment with the Standard Model and
  is in agreement at the <1% level. </p>
  
  <p>Groups that calculate parity violation effects in cesium [4,7,11,12]
  also calculate electron EDM effects in cesium [4,7,8,10,11]:
  <ul><li>Both calculations start with the Dirac equation.</li>
  <li>Both calculations use the same relativistic wave functions.</li>
  <li>Both calculations apply the same atomic structure corrections.</li>
  <li>Both calculations use the same tests against cesium hyperfine constants 
  and other quantities.</li> 
  <li>Both results are often published in the same paper[4,7,11].</li></ul>
  
  The results for cesium EDM are also consistent between groups and over time. 
  The first calculation published in 1965 obtained a ratio of 119 [1]. </p>
   
   <p>In addition to parity violation and EDM effects in cesium,
    there are calculations, carried out (often by the same authors who calculate
    EDM and parity violation effects) 
    using similar relativistic codes and wavefunctions, 
    of hundreds of other measured quantities in cesium, and other alkali atoms.</p>
    
    <p>These calculations have been experimentally tested tested, and include
       atomic transition probabilities [14], hyperfine splittings,
      and saclar and tensor polarizability. Polarizability measurements are of
      particular interest because they involve the measurement of 
      energy shifts due to application of a strong electric field [15]. </p><br>

  <!--    </p><br>
    <li> <h3>Atom EDM Ratios</h3></li>
    <p>The EDM enhancement ratios R provide a powerful check against
      an EDM mimic by allowing a comparison between cesium and rubidium and/or francium - 
      all relatively easy to trap and cool. Measured atom EDMs in the ratio of 35:5:1 
      for Fr:Cs:Rb would be compelling evidence that the effect was not an EDM mimic.
      Systematic effects tend to be atom-independent for magnetic field effects,
      or decrease with Z for geometric phase effects. And were a Tl experiment available,
      its EDM of opposite sign (presumably because the p state has opposite parity) could
      be an additional check. </p> <hr> -->
      
     
    <h3>Other EDM Effects in Cesium</h3>
 	<p>Although a linear Stark effect may arise from sources other than an electron 
  			EDM, heavy alkali atoms are presumed much more sensitive to an electron EDM 
  			than to an EDM of nucleons[16], a nuclear EDM, or a parity- 
  			and time reversal- violating: electron-nucleus, nucleon-nucleon, or 
  			electron-electron interaction. Any 
  			of these however would be welcome as evidence of new physics.</p><hr><br>

		 This widely cited 1989 paper rederives the Hamiltonian for the atomic EDM, 
		 catalogs terms that need to be added to the calculations to improve accuracy, 
		 and estimates their relative importance. Having a
		second derivation of the Hamiltonian helps remove a possible source uncertainty.

		<!--Adds double core polarization to both parity violation calculations and electron EDM
		enhancement factors bringing several calculations ofeach that use differing treatments closer

		If we treat Tl as a monovalence system, then the DCP contribution to the 
		PNC amplitude is huge. It contributes 36% to the PNC amplitude of the 6p1/2-6p3/2 
		transition and about 60% to the EDM of the ground state. 
		The DCP contribution is strongly dominated by the 6s electrons. 
		This reflects the well-known fact that the correlations between the 
		three outermost electrons in thallium are strong and should be treated accurately. 
		In our view, the best approach is to treat thallium as a triple-valence-electron 
		system and to use the configuration interaction (CI) technique 
		combined with many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) for including 
		valence electrons core interactions. 
		However, good results can be obtained in other approaches too 
		if correlations between 6s and 6p electrons, including the DCP contribution, 
		are treated accurately. In our early calculations of the PNC in thallium [13], 
		it was treated as a monovalence system and the DCP contribution was included. 
		Recent calculations of the EDM enhancement factor [28,31] 
		used the CI approach; the calculations of the Tl EDM based 
		on the coupled-cluster approach [14,32] seems to include the DCP contribution too
		by introducing the perturbed excitation operators T1 and T2 (see [14] for details).
